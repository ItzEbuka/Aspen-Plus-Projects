# Process Description — BTX Separation through Distillation

A mixture of benzene (400 kg/h), toluene (600 kg/h) and p-xylene (100 kg/h) at 30 °C and 1.3 bar needs to be separated via distillation with minimum purity of 95% benzene, and 97% toluene. The downstream pressures of benzene, toluene, and p-xylene lines should be 6, 3 and 4 bars respectively. Following strategies should be adopted:

1. Verification of boiling points of each component using physical property methods, viz. Pure Component and PT envelope.

2. Verification of K values and relative volatilities of each component (light and heavy keys) using "Flash" block simulation.

3. Find minimum reflux ratio and/or minimum number of stages using DSTWU model. Optimize RR vs. stages.

4. Simulate real condition using "Distl" block.

5. Verify purity of all distilled components and their exit condition after the overall simulation.
