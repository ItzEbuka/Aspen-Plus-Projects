# ‚öóÔ∏è Aspen Plus Simulation Projects ‚Äî Chemical Engineering Processes

This repository contains a collection of **Aspen Plus simulation projects** developed to model and analyze various **chemical engineering processes**.  
Each project demonstrates the application of process simulation in understanding and optimizing real industrial systems such as **reaction engineering, separation processes, energy integration, and process design**.

The simulations cover a wide range of topics including **biodiesel production from waste oils, hydrocarbon separation, neutralization reactions, cumene synthesis, and ammonia production**.  
Each project folder contains:
- The Aspen Plus simulation file (`.apwz`)
- A process description markdown file for the simulation (`Procedure.md`)
- A project-specific `README.md` explaining process flow, equipment used, and key insights.
